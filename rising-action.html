        <h2>💕 Meeting Latte</h2>
        <p>The shelter was quiet, filled with tiny meows. We were sure we’d get a tortie, but then we saw them—<strong class="highlight">two tiny ginger American Shorthairs</strong> curled up together, barely awake.</p>
        <p>When I reached for one, she <strong class="highlight">wiggled away</strong>, leaving her sleepy sister behind. The staff handed her to me, and the moment I held her, I knew... she was <strong class="highlight">the one</strong>.</p>
