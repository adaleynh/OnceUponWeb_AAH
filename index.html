        <h2>🐱 A Surprise Date & A Dangerous Idea</h2>
        <p>It started as an ordinary day—an impromptu date planned by my boyfriend. I had no idea where we were going, but when we arrived at a <strong>kitty café<strong>, I was ecstatic.</p>
        <p>We played with <strong class="highlight">so many cats</strong> and fell in love with all of them. We joked about how hard it would be to leave without adopting one... and then we made the <strong class="highlight">dangerous</strong> decision to visit a shelter.</p>
